Hi there! I’m Adheeb, I work primarily on the implications of generative ai and computer vision in research applications.

Previously, I was an Intern Software Engineer at SLTMobitel, where I built and deployed generative models powering the company's first-ever enterprise multimodal agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. I also gained significant experience developing backend services and contributing to frontend development.

I spend a reasonable amount of time exploring philosophy, science fiction, and literature to view odds from different perspectives. On the side, I’m a steady Sudoku player — nothing flashy, but consistent enough to stay sharp.
